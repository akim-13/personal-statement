    I wrote my first ever computer program in Pascal about 8 years ago. As for 
the most programmers, a simple "Hello, World!" opened up a whole new world of
possibilities. In a few months I coded a more advanced version of the arcade 
called Space Invaders with an adjustable shooting angle and a few other 
additional features, which made both me and the 70's proud. 

    After that I have never stopped experimenting with the languages: from 
back-end to front-end, from useful to esoteric, from feature-rich and
high-level to the ones close to the machine code... The sheer thrill and
excitement, which always accompanied the influx of new information and
challenges, have kept pushing me for improvement throughout all these years. 

    I studied in one of the best high schools in the country that specialises
in maths and computer science. During a 4 year period we covered a lot of
complex topics, some of which are usually studied in the second and the
following years of university. Case in point, whilst programming in C we have
done: AVL trees, Huffman coding, OpenGL rendering and much more. Since C is
considered a relatively hard to learn programming language and the
aforementioned tasks were quite complicated, learning new languages had become
a piece of cake.

    A few years ago I started to be more and more aware about the flip side of
the unprecedented convenience of the modern world digital technology, that is
the business model of the big tech companies based on collection of personal
data for improving their eerily addictive algorithms and later sale to
advertisers. I could not stay indifferent to such an invasion of personal
privacy for long, so I started to research. After finding out a lot of great
alternatives and driven by a yet unbeknownst [Is it possible to be driven by
something yet unbeknownst?] desire of wanting to look under the hood, I
completely revolutionised my digital lifestyle. It began with an operating
system: switching to an open source OS such as Linux allowed me to decompose
any action that is undertaken inside of it down to the lowest possible level.
while it was by no means an easy task, which had taken me years to complete,
it allowed me to fully understand and trust the system I use on a daily basis.
Not to mention the sheer amount of acquired skill and especially knowledge that
came with this process, part of which I documented in my EPQ project "WIP EPQ
project name".

(CONCLUSION)
Nonetheless, the real journey, be it a university course work or a real-world
application, is only about to begin.
