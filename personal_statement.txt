I wrote my first computer program in Pascal about 8 years ago. As with most
programmers, a simple "Hello, World!" opened up a whole world of possibilities.
Within a few months, I had coded a more advanced version of the arcade game
Space Invaders with an adjustable shooting angle and other additional features,
which made both me and the 70s proud.

Before coming to the UK I studied in a school that specializes in Maths and
Computer Science. Most of the coding was done in C, some of the more complex
covered topics were AVL trees, Huffman coding, OpenGL object rendering and
graph algorithms. The latter especially interested me, so I am currently
revisiting this topic by coding Kruskal's algorithm and researching the
travelling salesman problem. I also enjoy solving challenging problems in my
other A-levels: Economics and Maths. Case in point, Project Euler is an archive
of hundreds of programming/mathematical tests, which I like to solve in my free
time. Taking economics has greatly helped me to develop my writing skills,
which I believe to be essential for any individual, as it helps to formulate
and organize an informed, coherent and sophisticated set of ideas.
Consequently, it means that writing is the deepest form of thinking.

After watching a documentary "The Social Dilemma", I became more aware of the
problems with the unprecedented convenience of modern world digital technology.
Namely the business model of big tech companies, based on collecting personal
data to improve their eerily addictive algorithms, and later sale to
advertisers. Coincidentally, A book by Richard M. Stallman "Free Software, Free
Society" introduced me to the world of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software),
which I ultimately made the subject of my EPQ — "Linux: an OS you control" —
[punctuation?] further inspired by the co-founder of the operating system
itself — Linus Torvalds. My research demonstrated how by looking "under the
hood", i.e. meticulously decomposing every action undertaken in the OS, it
becomes possible for a user to control the system, instead of the system
controlling the user.

I moved to the UK to study last year, which opened a multitude of
possibilities. Studying alongside like-minded people, and having unlimited
access to texts written in English allowed me to expand and develop my field of
interest in Maths and CS. Reading Clean Code by Robert C. Martin and Andrew
Hunt's The Pragmatic Programmer revolutionised my coding style, so much so that
even someone with zero programming experience could grasp the main idea and the
flow of a program, i.e. the code has become a lot more readable and
maintainable. Behind Deep Blue, describing the creation of the first Artificial
Intelligence that in 1997 defeated the world chess champion, led me to enroll
for a two-week AI summer course at the University of Oxford, which covered
machine learning in depth. I am keen to explore this further, along with other
emerging fields such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain, building on the work
experience  I undertook as a consultant in the Swiss cryptocurrency investment
and project development business Euratek GmbH (a [this phrase if from their
website: https://euratek.co/about-us/]). All of this would not have been
possible without the aid of O'Reilly academic textbooks like "Mastering
Bitcoin" or Linux and Python guides.

I believe that physical and mental health are intertwined, and am always trying
to do something meaningful outside my academic routine: be it sport (7 years of
tennis and 4 years of MMA), volunteering activities (like co-ordinating a
fundraising Night Walk for the National Autistic Society), or just helping out
the college (since YEAR, I have been acting as ‘Digital Innovator’ in the
Student Council [Less pretentious phrasing?]). (*WIP witty last sentence to
leave a good impression.*)
