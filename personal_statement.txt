Many years before I was born, in an interview he gave in 1995, Steve Jobs
famously said: “Everybody should learn how to program a computer – should learn
a computer language, because it teaches you how to think.” I could not agree
with it more strongly: software engineering is, without doubt, the most
exciting thing I know. Having discovered it at the age of 10 by learning Pascal
at my school’s extracurricular programming club, within just a few months I had
rapidly progressed from the obligatory “Hello World” to writing my own version
of the 1970s classic arcade game, “Space Invaders”, complete with an adjustable
shooting angle and other additional features. 

As my school in Saint Petersburg specialised in Maths and Computer Science, I
had ample opportunities to continue to develop and hone my abilities. At first,
I focused on the challenge of learning the fundamentals of C; although my
initial progress was slow and hard-won, I gradually came to terms with its
syntactic rigour, the difference between pointers and references, and the
intricacies of dynamic memory allocation. I continued to build on this
foundation by studying object-oriented languages like C++ and Java,
subsequently implementating an AVL tree from scratch, solidifying my grasp of
recursion in the process, to then use my newfound understanding of binary trees
in Huffman coding. By using the OpengGL API I also designed and animated a
functioning 3D vehicle to extend my knowledge to other CS fields.

Coming to the UK last year to continue my education had allowed me to focus on
the subjects relevant to my future career choice. A-levels in Maths and Further
Maths gave me a new perspective on the familiar concepts, such as learning the
relevance of probability distributions and statistical expectations to data
compression. I also decided to teach myself the Decision Mathematics modules in
my spare time, which gave me an insight into Graph Theory algorithms, such as
Prim’s or Kruskal’s, and inspired me to write a version of them in Python.
Finally, I was able to write dynamic simulations global economic markets by
combining my knowledge of mathematical models and A-Level Economics.

Like every great technology, computers also give their users unique ways to
misuse them. Watching a documentary "The Social Dilemma" made me consider the
downsides of an interconnected global society, which lets big tech companies to
collect and trade personal data of their users, using it to shape public
attitudes and opinions. To investigate this further, I read "Free Software,
Free Society" by Richard M. Stallman, which introduced me to the world of Free
and open-source software. This became the topic of my EPQ, "Linux: an OS you
control", in which I demonstrated how by meticulously decomposing every action
undertaken in the OS, it becomes possible for a user to control the system,
instead of the system controlling the user.

I always strive to grow my knowledge of coding and the algorithms involved
therein. "Behind Deep Blue", a book about the IBM chess supercomputer that
defeated the world champion Garry Kasparov in 1997, encouraged me to enrol into
a two-week summer course on machine learning at the University of Oxford, where
I studied genetic algorithms and the fundamentals of constructing a deep neural
network. To improve the quality of my code, I read books like "Clean Code" by
Robert C. Martin and Andrew Hunt's "The Pragmatic Programmer," putting their
suggestions into practice to make my work more concise, readable, maintainable,
and efficient. Last summer, I began to research cryptocurrencies and the
blockchain technology, which led me to complete a two-week internship at
Euratek GmbH, a Swiss company providing digital currency investment services.
Being exposed to the day-to-day operations allowed me to witness first-hand the
challenges of dealing with the inherently volatile virtual currency markets,
and the importance of effective software solutions to mitigate the
unpredictability thereof. 

I believe that physical and mental health are intertwined, highlighting the
essential nature of keeping active no matter the academic workload at hand. I
have been playing tennis for 7 years and have 4 years of MMA experience. I
greatly enjoy volunteering, having recently coordinated a fundraiser, “Night
Walk for the National Autistic Society”. Not to mention that I was appointed to
the position of the Digital Innovator in the Student Council. This has given me
a great opportunity to help out the college by, for example, administrating and
improving a local rewards system Epraise.
