    I wrote my first ever computer program in Pascal about 8 years ago. As with
most programmers, a simple "Hello, World!" opened up a whole new world of
possibilities. In a few months I coded a more advanced version of the arcade
game Space Invaders with an adjustable shooting angle and other additional
features, which made both me and the 70s proud. After that I never stopped
experimenting with the languages: from back-end to front-end, from useful to
esoteric, from feature-rich and high-level to the ones close to the machine
code. The thrill and excitement, which always accompanied the influx of new
information and challenges, have kept pushing me to improve throughout the
intervening years.

    Studying in a school that specializes in Maths and Computer Science, I was
able to cover a range of complex topics
    I studied in one of the best high schools in the country that specialises
in maths and computer science. During a 4 year period we covered a lot of
complex topics, some of which are usually studied in the second and the
following years of university. Case in point, whilst programming in C we have
done: AVL trees, Huffman coding, OpenGL rendering and much more. Since C is
considered a relatively hard to learn programming language and the
aforementioned tasks were quite complicated, learning new languages had become
a piece of cake.

    I recently became more aware of the flip side of the unprecedented
convenience of modern world digital technology — the business model of the big
tech companies based on collection of personal data for improving their eerily
addictive algorithms and later sale to advertisers. This realization came after
an extensive research that started with a documentary "The Social Dilemma",
which goes in depth on the aforementioned issues. After reading "Free Software,
Free Society" by a computer scientist Richard M. Stallman [I'm aware of his
ideas, but haven't actually read the book, although I'm planning on doing so in
the nearest future. This sounds more impressive and appropriate than "watching
YouTube videos".] I found out about the world of FOSS (Free and Open Source
Software), which ultimately led me to the creation of an EPQ project called
"Linux: [the or an?] OS you control", inspired by a genius programmer and the
co-founder of the operating system itself — Linus Torvalds. In this project I
show that by looking under the hood [I really like this phrase], i.e.
meticulously decomposing every undertaken action, it becomes possible for a
user to control the system, instead of the system controlling the user.

    Moving and studying in the UK for the past year opened up a ton of
possibilities. Case in point, new like-minded people and an unlimited access to
English literature allowed me to expand and develop my field of interest in
Maths and CS beyond anything I could ever dream of. For example, reading "Clean
Code" by Robert C. Martin and Andrew Hunt's "The Pragmatic Programmer" has
utterly revolutionised my coding style, so much so that even someone with zero
programming experience could grasp the main idea and the flow of a program,
i.e. the code has become a lot more readable and maintainable. "Behind Deep
Blue", the book about the creation of the first Artificial Intelligence that in
1997 defeated the world chess champion, has sparked my interest in the field of
AI and led me to enroll for a two-week summer course in Oxford, where we went in
depth on the topic of machine learning. Subsequently, I am now considering
dedicating my future work to this and other CS fields, like cryptocurrencies
and blockchain, where I already have work experience after completing [better
verb?] an internship as a consultant in a Swiss company Euratek GmbH (a
cryptocurrency investment and project development business [this phrase if from
their website: https://euratek.co/about-us/]). All of this would not have been
possible without the aid of O'Reilly academic textbooks like "Mastering
Bitcoin" or Linux and Python guides.

(CONCLUSION)
Nonetheless, the real journey, be it a university course work or a real-world
application, is only about to begin.

TODO: 
- Redo the paragraph about academic topics and link other A-levels
- Mention project Euler and maybe maths books to show interest in maths.
- Mention non-academic stuff (student council, volunteering) (potentially in the conclusion)
- Conclusion
