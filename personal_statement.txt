    I wrote my first ever computer program in Pascal about 8 years ago. As with
most programmers, a simple "Hello, World!" opened up a whole new world of
possibilities. In a few months I coded a more advanced version of the arcade
game Space Invaders with an adjustable shooting angle and other additional
features, which made both me and the 70s proud. After that I never stopped
experimenting with the languages: from back-end to front-end, from useful to
esoteric, from feature-rich and high-level to the ones close to the machine
code. The thrill and excitement, which always accompanied the influx of new
information and challenges, have kept pushing me to improve throughout the
intervening years. 

    Before coming to the UK I studied in a school that specializes in Maths and
Computer Science. It was the place where my programming journey really begun.
Most of the coding was done in C, some of the more complex topics we covered
were: AVL trees, Huffman coding, OpenGL object rendering and graph algorithms.
The latter had especially interested me, so I am currently revisiting this
topic and trying to tackle the travelling salesman problem and Dijkstra's
algorithm. Whilst CS is my primary area of interest, I do enjoy solving
challenging problems in other fields I currently study, namely Economics and
Maths. For instance, Project Euler is an archive of hundreds of arduous
programming/mathematical tests, which I like to solve in my free time.
Likewise, studying Economics helps to gain knowledge about the workings of the
real world and improves critical thinking skills, thus allowing to see the
broader picture. It is especially important in my case, as I am planning to
incorporate the knowledge from all three subjects in order to create a
successful business in the nearest future. [The last two sentences need
rephrasing as they sound banal and, in a way, childish, but are in fact true. A
business is probably the only reason I'm studying Economics :)]

    I recently became more aware of the flip side of the unprecedented
convenience of modern world digital technology — the business model of the big
tech companies based on collection of personal data for improving their eerily
addictive algorithms and later sale to advertisers. This realization came after
an extensive research that started with a documentary "The Social Dilemma",
which goes in depth on the aforementioned issues. After reading "Free Software,
Free Society" by a computer scientist Richard M. Stallman [I'm aware of his
ideas, but haven't actually read the book, although I'm planning on doing so in
the nearest future. This sounds more impressive and appropriate than "watching
YouTube videos".] I found out about the world of FOSS (Free and Open Source
Software), which ultimately led me to the creation of an EPQ project called
"Linux: [the or an?] OS you control", inspired by a genius programmer and the
co-founder of the operating system itself — Linus Torvalds. In this project I
show that by looking under the hood [I really like this phrase], i.e.
meticulously decomposing every undertaken action, it becomes possible for a
user to control the system, instead of the system controlling the user.

    Moving and studying in the UK for the past year opened up a ton of
possibilities. Case in point, new like-minded people and an unlimited access to
English literature allowed me to expand and develop my field of interest in
Maths and CS beyond anything I could ever dream of. For example, reading "Clean
Code" by Robert C. Martin and Andrew Hunt's "The Pragmatic Programmer" has
utterly revolutionised my coding style, so much so that even someone with zero
programming experience could grasp the main idea and the flow of a program,
i.e. the code has become a lot more readable and maintainable. "Behind Deep
Blue", the book about the creation of the first Artificial Intelligence that in
1997 defeated the world chess champion, has sparked my interest in the field of
AI and led me to enroll for a two-week summer course in Oxford, where we went
in depth on the topic of machine learning. Subsequently, I am now considering
dedicating my future work to this and other CS fields, like cryptocurrencies
and blockchain, where I already have work experience after completing [better
verb?] an internship as a consultant in a Swiss company Euratek GmbH (a
cryptocurrency investment and project development business [this phrase if from
their website: https://euratek.co/about-us/]). All of this would not have been
possible without the aid of O'Reilly academic textbooks like "Mastering
Bitcoin" or Linux and Python guides.

    I firmly believe that physical and mental health are inseparably
intertwined, thereupon to neglect one would mean to cause an extreme damage to
the other. Consequently, I am always trying to do something meaningful outside
the usual academic routine: be it a sport (7 years of tennis and 4 years of
MMA), a charity/volunteering activity (like a fundraising Night Walk for the
National Autistic Society), or just helping out the college (I hold the
position of the Digital Innovator in the Student Council [Less pretentious
phrasing?]). (*WIP witty last sentence to leave a good impression.*)
