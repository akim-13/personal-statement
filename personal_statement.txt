I wrote my first computer program in Pascal about 8 years ago. As with most
programmers, a simple "Hello, World!" opened up a whole world of possibilities.
Within a few months, I had coded a more advanced version of the arcade game
Space Invaders with an adjustable shooting angle and other additional features,
which made both me and the 70s proud.

Before coming to the UK I studied in a school that specializes in Maths and
Computer Science. This was where my programming journey began. Most of the
coding was done in C, but we also covered AVL trees, Huffman coding, OpenGL
object rendering and graph algorithms. The latter especially interested me, so
I am currently revisiting this topic by coding Kruskal's algorithm and
researching the travelling salesman problem. I also enjoy solving challenging
problems in my other A-levels, Economics and Maths: Project Euler is an archive
of hundreds of programming/mathematical tests, which I like to solve in my free
time;

studying Economics has helped me to learn about the workings of the real
world and improve my critical thinking, thus allowing to see the broader
picture.  I am planning to incorporate the knowledge from all three subjects in
order to create a successful business. [The last two sentences need rephrasing
as they sound banal and, in a way, childish, but are in fact true. A business
is probably the only reason I'm studying Economics :)]

After watching the documentary The Social Dilemma, I became more aware of the
problems with the unprecedented convenience of modern world digital technology
— the business model of big tech companies, based on collecting personal data
to improve their eerily addictive algorithms and sell it on to advertisers. I
read Free Software, Free Society by Richard M. Stallman [I'm aware of his
ideas, but haven't actually read the book, although I'm planning on doing so in
the nearest future. This sounds more impressive and appropriate than "watching
YouTube videos".] and I found out about the world of FOSS (Free and Open Source
Software), which I ultimately made the subject of my EPQ project, "Linux: [the
or an?] OS you control", inspired by the co-founder of the operating system
itself — Linus Torvalds. My research demonstrated how by looking ‘under the
hood’ [I really like this phrase], i.e. meticulously decomposing every
programming action, it becomes possible for a user to control the system,
instead of the system controlling the user.

I moved to the UK to study last year, which opened a multitude of
possibilities. Studying alongside like-minded people, and having unlimited
access to texts written in English allowed me to expand and develop my field of
interest in Maths and CS. Reading Clean Code by Robert C. Martin and Andrew
Hunt's The Pragmatic Programmer revolutionised my coding style, so much so that
even someone with zero programming experience could grasp the main idea and the
flow of a program, i.e. the code has become a lot more readable and
maintainable. Behind Deep Blue, describing the creation of the first Artificial
Intelligence that in 1997 defeated the world chess champion, led me to enroll
for a two-week AI summer course at the University of Oxford, which covered
machine learning in depth. I am keen to explore this further, along with other
emerging fields such as cryptocurrencies and blockchain, building on the work
experience  I undertook as a consultant in the Swiss cryptocurrency investment
and project development business Euratek GmbH (a [this phrase if from their
website: https://euratek.co/about-us/]). All of this would not have been
possible without the aid of O'Reilly academic textbooks like "Mastering
Bitcoin" or Linux and Python guides.

I believe that physical and mental health are intertwined, and am always trying
to do something meaningful outside my academic routine: be it sport (7 years of
tennis and 4 years of MMA), volunteering activities (like co-ordinating a
fundraising Night Walk for the National Autistic Society), or just helping out
the college (since YEAR, I have been acting as ‘Digital Innovator’ in the
Student Council [Less pretentious phrasing?]). (*WIP witty last sentence to
leave a good impression.*)
