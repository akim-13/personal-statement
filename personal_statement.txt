    I wrote my first ever computer program in Pascal about 8 years ago. As for 
the most programmers, a simple "Hello, World!" opened up a whole new world of
possibilities. In a few months I coded a more advanced version of the arcade 
called Space Invaders with an adjustable shooting angle and a few other 
additional features, which made both me and the 70's proud. 

    After that I have never stopped experimenting with the languages: from back-end
to front-end, from useful to esoteric, from feature-rich and high-level to the
ones close to the machine code... The sheer thrill and excitement, which always
accompanied the influx of new information and challenges, have kept pushing me
for improvement throughout all these years. 

    I studied in one of the best high schools in the country that specialises
in maths and computer science. During a 4 year period we covered a lot of
complex topics, some of which are usually studied in the second and the
following years of university. Case in point, whilst programming in C we have
done: AVL trees, Huffman coding, OpenGL rendering and much more. Since C is
considered a relatively hard to learn programming language and the
aforementioned tasks were quite complicated, learning new languages had become
a piece of cake.

(CONCLUSION)
Nonetheless, the real journey, be it a university course work or a real-world
application, is only about to begin.
